<h2>Canine Kerfuffle</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept: Doggy momentum</strong>
You control a dog with slippery momentum.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals: Casual</strong>
Little experience required.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre: Platformer</strong>
The mechanics are intended for the platforming genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls a dog who, once moved, continues to slide. Compounding left or right input (by holding left or right down) builds momentum. The player can jump which starts at a high velocity, slows down as they approach maximum jump height, falls at a low yet increasing velocity, and ends when the player has returned to the surface.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Fine tuning momentum and jumping mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The effort put into momentum makes player movement less rigid and predictable. By making the controls slightly unwieldy, the player has a skill to master.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player controls a slippery pup attempting to find his owners. He is lost in a field and his panic has hastened his pace. He wants to find his owners as quickly as possible. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The dog is lost and scared, reaching for the strand of hope that he can be reunited with his loved ones.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone who likes dogs.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Only a few minutes, just enough time for a quick challenge.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Learning to control the dog's momentum through practice.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I studied the phaser game Starstruck to understand movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Super Mario Bros. due to it's momentum, but Starstruck from phaser is a clear inspiration.
